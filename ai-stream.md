# Simple Proof of Concept
- Prompt field
- Response card
- "Generate" button

1. User enters a prompt in the input field. i.e. "Sample JSON"
2. User clicks the "Generate" button.
3. The app sends the prompt to the AI model.
3. The AI model processes the prompt and generates a JSON response with the mock data the user requested
4. The response is streamed live to the user, they can see it appear in real time as it is generated in the response card.

This is done in Next.js + Vercel + Supabase + OpenAI API + Shadcn UI.

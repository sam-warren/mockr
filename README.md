# mockr.io: Context-Aware Mock Data Generation Platform  

## Executive Summary  
mockr.io addresses the critical gap between static mock data libraries (Faker.js) and production-like datasets by introducing **context-aware AI generation** that understands application-specific relationships. Built on Next.js/Supabase with Stripe monetization, the platform enables developers to create dynamic test data that mirrors real-world scenarios through natural language prompts and schema-aware AI models. With 83% of developers reporting inadequate testing data quality (2024 State of Software Testing Report), mockr.io positions itself as the first SaaS solution combining ease of use with semantic data integrity.  

---

## Competitive Differentiation Strategy  
### 1. Semantic Relationship Mapping  
Unlike Faker.js' random data:  
- **AI Context Engine**: Analyzes database schemas/API specs to maintain referential integrity (user.address → valid geolocation)[1]  
- **Cross-Entity Constraints**: Automatically enforces `order.user_id` ↔ `users.id` relationships during generation  

### 2. Real-World Data Patterns  
- **Industry Templates**: Pre-built profiles for healthcare (HIPAA-compliant mock PHI), e-commerce (plausible product taxonomies)  
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Generates user activity timelines with realistic session intervals  

### 3. Developer-Centric Workflows  
- **VS Code Extension**: In-IDE data generation with `⌘ + Shift + M` shortcut  
- **GitHub Action**: CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test dataset refresh  

---

## Technical Implementation Roadmap  

### Phase 1: MVP Launch (Weeks 1-4)  
**Core Features**  
- **Schema Editor**: Visual interface for defining entities/relationships (React Flow + Shadcn)  
- **AI Prompt Engine**: GPT-4 fine-tuned for data generation rules (Supabase Edge Functions)  
- **Basic Exporters**: JSON/CSV download with TypeScript type definitions  

**Stack Components**  
```typescript
// Sample Supabase Table Structure for Saved Schemas
const createTableSQL = `
  CREATE TABLE schemas (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users,
    name TEXT,
    entities JSONB[],
    relationships JSONB[],
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
  );
`;
```

### Phase 2: AI Optimization (Months 2-3)  
- **Contextual Awareness**:  
  - Train custom LoRA model on public database schemas (PostgreSQL/MySQL docs)  
  - Implement vector search for schema recommendations (pgvector)  
- **Performance**:  
  - Cache generated datasets in Supabase Storage with TTL  
  - Edge-cached API endpoints via Vercel  

### Phase 3: Enterprise Readiness (Months 4-6)  
- **Team Workspaces**: Role-based access control (Admin/Editor/Viewer)  
- **Audit Logs**: Track data generation history for compliance  
- **SAML/SSO**: Integration with Okta/Azure AD

## Monetization & Pricing  

### Tier Structure  
| Tier        | Price     | Features                          |  
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|  
| **Hobby**   | Free      | 100 gen/month, Basic Schemas      |  
| **Pro**     | $29/month | 5K gen/month, Webhooks, Priority Support |  
| **Team**    | $99/month | 20K gen/month, Shared Workspaces  |  
| **Enterprise** | Custom   | SLA, On-prem Deployment, Custom AI Models |  

**Differentiation from Free Alternatives**  
- **Version Control**: Git-style history of schema changes  
- **Compliance Ready**: Auto-redact PII in healthcare/finance templates  
- **Collaboration**: Real-time schema editing with multiplayer cursor  

---

## Go-to-Market Plan  

### Target Channels  
1. **Technical Content Marketing**  
   - Publish "Testing Microservices with Realistic Data" guide series  
   - Develop Jupyter Notebook integration for ML workflows  

2. **Platform Partnerships**  
   - Vercel Integration Directory listing  
   - Supabase Marketplace featured placement  

3. **Community Building**  
   - "Mock Data Challenges" with AWS/Azure credits as prizes  
   - Open-source core SDK under MIT License  

### Conversion Funnel

    D --> E[Upsell: Pro Features]
```

---

## Operational Automation  

### CI/CD Pipeline  
1. **Automated Testing**  
   - Playwright tests for schema editor interactions  
   - Load testing with k6 for data generation API  

2. **Cost Controls**  
   - Alert when AI model costs exceed 30% of revenue  
   - Auto-pause free tier accounts hitting limits  

3. **Support Stack**  
   - Resend for transactional emails  
   - Crisp chat widget with AI pre-screening  

---

## Risk Mitigation  

### Technical Risks  
- **AI Hallucinations**: Implement schema validation layer pre-generation  
- **Data Leakage**: Isolate customer datasets via Supabase RLS  

### Market Risks  
- **Faker.js Competition**: Focus on UI/UX and enterprise features  
- **Pricing Sensitivity**: Offer annual billing with 2 months free

## Financial Projections  

| Metric         | Month 6 | Month 12 |  
|----------------|---------|----------|  
| MAU            | 5,200   | 18,000   |  
| Conversion Rate| 4.2%    | 6.1%     |  
| MRR            | $8,900  | $72,400  |  
| CAC            | $18     | $14      |  

---

## Conclusion: Execution Priorities  
1. **Leverage AI Specialization**: Double down on context-aware generation as core USP  
2. **Developer Ecosystem Integration**: Become the "Vercel for test data" through tight Next.js coupling  
3. **Usage-Based Expansion**: Introduce $0.25/1k extra generations post-free tier  

Initial focus on JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems allows rapid iteration based on vercel.com/deploy button analytics. Subsequent expansion into Python/Java markets can be funded through Series Seed round at 18-month mark.

## Authentication

Mockr uses GitHub OAuth for authentication. To set up GitHub OAuth:

1. Go to your GitHub account settings
2. Navigate to "Developer settings" > "OAuth Apps" > "New OAuth App"
3. Fill in the following details:
   - Application name: Mockr (or your preferred name)
   - Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
   - Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
4. Click "Register application"
5. Generate a new client secret
6. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
7. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project (copy from `.env.local.example`)
8. Add your GitHub Client ID and Client Secret to the `.env.local` file:
   ```
   AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
   AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Features

- Visual data modeling
- AI-assisted generation
- Smart relationships
- GitHub authentication

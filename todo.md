## **Mock Generation Flow**
- User visits `/mocks/new`
- User inputs a prompt and/or uploads a JSON schema
- User clicks "Generate Mock"
- The mock placeholder is created in the database and the user is navigated to /mocks/:id
- The server generates the mock data using OpenAI and populates the mock in the database, which is then displayed in real-time on the page using supabase realtime and streaming the response
- User can then view, edit, or delete the mock
- User can also download the mock data in various formats (JSON, SQL, Document (MongoDB))
